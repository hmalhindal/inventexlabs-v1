# **App Name**: FabQuote

## Core Features:

- CAD Upload: Upload CAD design files (e.g., DXF, DWG, STEP).
- Instant Quote: Use generative AI to identify manufacturable parts and automatically estimate material, labor, and machine time. LLM will use its tool for CAD interpretation and material cost data when computing the price.
- Quotation Display: Display the quotation, including estimated cost, material, and lead time.
- Service Selection: Support for laser cutting and CNC machining services.
- Material and Quantity Selection: Enable users to choose materials and desired quantity.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Steel blue (#4682B4) for a professional and precise feel, referencing the materials and processes involved.
- Background color: Light gray (#EEEEEE) to provide a neutral backdrop that ensures readability.
- Accent color: Light blue (#ADD8E6) to highlight interactive elements and calls to action.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use clean, vector-based icons to represent different services (laser cutting, CNC machining), file formats, and material options.
- Employ a clear, structured layout to guide users through the quote request and order placement process.
- Subtle animations for loading states, form submissions, and quote updates to enhance user experience.
