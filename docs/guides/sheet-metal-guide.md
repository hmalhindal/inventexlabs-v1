# Sheet Metal Design Guide

### Key Considerations

*   **Uniform Thickness**: Design parts with a single, uniform material thickness.
*   **Bend Radii**: Keep all bend radii consistent and ideally equal to or greater than the material thickness.
*   **Bend Relief**: Add bend reliefs at the edge of flanges to prevent tearing. Reliefs should be at least as wide as the material thickness.
*   **Hole Placement**: Place holes and features at least 2.5 times the material thickness away from bends to avoid deformation.
*   **Hems**: Use open hems for safe edges, and closed (flattened) hems for increased stiffness.
*   **Flat Pattern**: Always consider the flat pattern. Ensure no features overlap or interfere after bending.
