# CNC Machining Design Guide

### Key Considerations

*   **Tolerances**: Specify only where necessary. Tighter tolerances increase cost.
*   **Wall Thickness**: Avoid thin walls (under 0.8mm for metal, 1.5mm for plastic) to prevent warping and chatter.
*   **Internal Radii**: All internal corners will have a radius from the cutting tool. Design with the largest possible radii. A radius of at least 1/3 of the cavity depth is a good rule of thumb.
*   **Hole Design**: Use standard drill sizes. For deep holes (depth > 6x diameter), be aware of potential issues. Specify threads clearly.
*   **Undercuts**: Avoid undercuts as they require special tooling and increase costs.
*   **Text**: Engraved text is easier and cheaper to machine than raised text.
