# Instant Quoting

Our instant quoting engine is at the heart of the Inventex Labs platform. It uses advanced AI and computational geometry to analyze your uploaded design files.

### How It Works

1.  **Geometry Analysis**: The platform inspects your CAD file to determine key features like dimensions, volume, hole counts, and complexity.
2.  **Material & Process Data**: It cross-references this analysis with our database of material costs and manufacturing process parameters (e.g., machine time, labor costs).
3.  **Cost Calculation**: The system calculates a detailed cost breakdown, including material cost, estimated labor, and machine time.
4.  **DFM Feedback**: Simultaneously, the platform provides Design for Manufacturability (DFM) feedback, highlighting potential issues that could increase cost or complexity.

This entire process happens in seconds, providing you with a transparent and accurate estimate to make informed decisions quickly.
